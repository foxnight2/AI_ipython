# Python for Beginner

>> You'll start with the very basics to lay a solid foundation for future learning. Then, you'll go deeper, learning more advanced ways of manipulating data with commonly used data structures. Later on, I will share some pointers with you about how to get data in and out of files and even store complex data structures in them. ~~After that, You will learn some basic concepts about <u>*machine learning*</u>, and use ML to solve data-related problems.~~
